// try to print the blockchain after you change the

//Pow: is false. so that means our implementation we doesn't have
// a dynamic prof of work difficuly, because the Nonce of our
//block is stored in the DB but not the actual validation boolean
//that's means when we are going to print it the actual hash not been signed for
//the new difficulty, and so when we run the validate function
//on the nonce comes back as a failure
